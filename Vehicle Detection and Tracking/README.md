## Udacity Self Driving Car Nano Degree :  Vehicle Detection and Tracking ##

Main goal of the project is to create a software pipeline to detect the car in the image frame using the machine learning algorithm. The linear SVM model is first trained by using the car and non car images. Sliding window approach is used to detect the cars in each sub windows of the image frame from the video.
