# Behavioral Cloning - Convolutional Neural Network #

## Udacity Self Driving Car Nano Degree :  Behavioral Cloning Project ##

Main goal of the project is to create a neural network to control the steering of a car using the video stream from the cameras mounted on the front bonnet of vehicle.

The neural network's structure is same as NVIDIA's Network Architecture and the training data is generated by manual driving of the car in the simulator.
