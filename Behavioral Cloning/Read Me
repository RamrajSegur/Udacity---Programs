Behavioral Cloning Project:
===========================

This directory is having the code and result (.h5 file and video.mp4 file) for the behavioral cloning project I have done.


The model is inpired NVIDIA's Neural network and then trained based on the data generated by human driving using Unix. 


Drive.py is used to drive the car with model.h5 file generated as a result of the neural network model.


Video.mp4 is a recorded video for car driving autonomouly around the track.
